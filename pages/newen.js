          For writing through Anky, our users will earn a cryptocurrency:
          $newen.
        </p>
        <p>
          This token exists on base blockchain, and it serves as the
          crystallization of life force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing through Anky requires a lot of focus, for a long period of
          time (8 minutes). This focus and energy is then transformed into this
          token, as a reward mechanism.
