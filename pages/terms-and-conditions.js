        “Anky Is You SpA” is a company that is located in Chile, and that deals
        with law through the entity with RUT number “77.796.373-2”. Throughout
        this document, that company will be referred to as “us”, “we”, “our”,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        For simplicity, and for the whole rest of this document, the reader of
        it, and person that is invited to this process is referred to as “you”,
        “your”, etc.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        That same “you” is the one that will be subject to inquiry through this
        whole adventure that we are embarking on together.

          You acknowledge that this process starts on the 31st of March, on this
          exact timestamp: 1711861200, and that this third sojourn will last for
          96 days. A day is a 24-hour period, counted exactly in relationship to
          that timestamp.

          You acknowledge that it is your personal responsibility to remember to
          write every day. Our mission is to create a system and network that
          actually helps you remember, but we will understand through trial and
          error how does that system look like. We will then iterate with your
          feedback and doing our best to understand your needs as a user. But
          that takes time, and patience, and needs to be a two-sided
          relationship. In the meantime, this{" "}

          You acknowledge that every 8-minute piece of writing that you create
          through Anky is public (at least on the initial phase), and that if
          you want to be anonymous you just have to create a new wallet with no
          attachments to your identity and find a way to get a mentor in there.

          You acknowledge that for writing you will receive a token called

          life force that happened on an 8-minute writing session.

          You acknowledge that you will own part of that book, and that every

          as “the first book that has ever been written by more than 100 humans
          in the history of humanity and it is a story that speaks about
          depression, technology, and the impact of addiction on the human

          move from a centralized world (jp being the one that is writing this
          document) into a decentralized world (where we find a way to agree on
          what this should say, and actually drive this ship in community), but
