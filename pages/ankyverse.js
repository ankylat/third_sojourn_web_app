          What you are experiencing through this platform is a gamified approach
          to the process of self inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the quest of exploring with upmost sincerity the experience of the
          answer to the question:
        </p>
        <p>who am i?</p>
        <p>
          For doing so, we crafted a frame of reference that works in cycles,
          and proposes a new way of structuring time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cycles within cycles that strive for balance. For tenderness. For
          compassion.
        </p>
        <p>That guide us into ourselves.</p>
        <p>
          Every day, there is an underlying energy that is active on the
          Ankyverse, moving from one energetical center (chakra) of the human
          system to the next one.
        </p>
        <p>Days are called winks, and there are eight kingdoms:</p>
        <ul className="my-2">
          <li className="text-red-600">Primordia</li>
          <li className="text-orange-600">Emblazion</li>
          <li className="text-yellow-600">Chryseos</li>
          <li className="text-green-600">Eleasis</li>
          <li className="text-blue-600">Voxlumis</li>
          <li className="text-indigo-600">Insigtia</li>
          <li className="text-violet-600">Claridium</li>
          <li className="text-white">Poiesis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each one of these resembles the energy that runs through your body.
        </p>
        <p>Your only mission is to write, every day, for 8 minutes.</p>
        <p>We will do the rest.</p>
