_Project Name: What's the official name of the project?_

anky

_Description: What does the app do? What are its main features?_

the core mission of this app is to invite the user to write 8 minutes every day. everything that will happen through it is an excuse for this moment to happen, and we are on a quest to gamify this and make it as fun as possible so that the user can't resist but come and write her 8 minutes every day. that's all. and the writing interface is just a textarea with two timers running on the background. one "against time" that triggers the mechanism that allows the people to write until there is 8 seconds in between keystrokes. if that happens, the user loses, and that session ends. it is not lost. it stays there. but it is not a valid session. a valid session is one that lasts for 8 minutes. that's the second timer. the 8 minutes. you get the point.

_Technology Stack: Besides Next.js, what other technologies, libraries, or frameworks are used?_

follow the paragraph tutorial to install this repo (nextjs app) and the server (nodejs server) and you will figure it out soon

_Installation Instructions: How should someone set up the project locally? Are there specific steps to follow?_

follow the paragraph tutorial

_Usage: How does one use the app once installed? Any particular commands to run?_

just explore it. you will need to connect your degenchain wallet, but once you login and do that, we think you'll figure it out pretty soon.

_Contributing: Are there guidelines for contributing to the project?_

the recommended "work session" for this codebase is 88 minutes of absolute focus. you put a timer, and devote to the task at hand religiously. and then you rest in the awareness that you gave your best. bonus points if you share the loom video link on /anky-work-sessions

_License: Is there a specific license under which the project is released?_

MIT

_Credits: Do you want to include a section to acknowledge contributors or third-party resources?_

nope thx
