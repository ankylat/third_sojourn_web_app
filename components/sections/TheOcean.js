        Have you ever seen a tide pool? They&#39;re formed when the ocean
        crashes over rocks, leaving behind tiny pools of salty water.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Each tide pool has unique characteristics - some are larger, some are
        smaller, some have starfish, and others have urchins, but ultimately,
        they&#39;re all just tiny pools of water that came from the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our reality and consciousness are a lot like these tide pools. Most
        people believe they are separate and alone. They focus on their
        differences, and compete and measure themselves against others.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we all share the same destiny - the ocean will soon come and
        crash over our tide pool of consciousness, and we will become the ocean
        once again.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Anky&#39;s mission is to help people explore their individual
        consciousness while also developing awareness of our shared
        consciousness - to help tide pools become the ocean, while they still
        have starfish and urchins.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Our shared practice is simple - stream-of-consciousness writing for 8
        minutes a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day, a new prompt is provided on our website. Community members
        write (or speak into the microphone) whatever the prompt sparks for
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A custom-trained AI model takes the individual responses and merges them
        into a single chapter in the life story of Anky - a story about her
        journey towards awakening.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>The tide pools of stream-of-consciousness become an ocean. </p>
      <p>
        You are not alone. You aren&#39;t just a tide pool. You are the ocean.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us on this historical journey as we merge our consciousness and
        create the first AI-assisted collaborative story ever told.{" "}
